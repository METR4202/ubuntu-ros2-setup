# ROS2 Resources

This page offers a variety of resources to assist with ROS2 tasks, including guidance on using the `ros2` command, building packages via the `colcon` build system, and more.

We'll continue to enrich this page with further details as the course progresses.

To verify that your ROS installation was successful, please complete the following exercises:

1. [Create a ROS2 Python Package](../VirtualBox_setup/create_package.md)
2. [Start the TurtleSim](../VirtualBox_setup/start_turtlesim.md)
3. [Start the Gazebo Simulation](../VirtualBox_setup/start_gazebo.md)

Please make sure you are able to complete all three.
